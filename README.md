# üìà ForexChurch frontend using 11ty/Bootstrap/Alpine.js/Axios (and maybe Flowbite, GSAP, Swiper)

This boilerplate/skeleton uses bits and pieces from the [Minimal 11ty Starter](https://github.com/tomreinert/minimal-11ty-tailwind-starter), please check it out first for the basics.

## üîó Demo

https://forexchurch-ten.vercel.app/

## üö∂ Getting started

1. git clone the repository
2. `cd forexchurch-11ty-alpinejs-bootstrap` (or the name of the folder you've cloned into)
3. install dependencies with `npm install`
4. watch for changes and serve locally on http://localhost:8080 with `npm run start`
5. compile the website with `npm run build` and serve it from the `_site` folder.
6. You can serve the compiled websiteffrom `_site` with `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`.

## üñ±Ô∏è UI Library

Take a look at the reusable snippets at http://localhost:8080/ui-library/

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development notes

* the top navbar (and the footer) uses semantic, auto-generated nested navigation. It is based on the folder structure, the template `/src/_includes/components/navigation.njk` and the front matter in individual files, e.g.

```

title: Fibonacci Calculator
date: 2024-02-18
excerpt: "To use the Fibonacci Calculator, first determine whether the trend of the range that you want to derive the Fibonacci levels for is an UPTREND or DOWNTREND. Once you have determined the trend, enter in the High Price and Low Price for the desired range. You can also enter a Custom Price that is used in the determination of the extension Levels - if Custom is left blank, the High and Low values are used instead."

<p>Lorem ipsum content...</p>
```

* For generic top/bottom section spacers use the `.py-section` class.
* Place individual SVG icons into the `/src/img/icons` folder and run `npm run svg` in order to generate `/src/img/icons/symbol/svg/sprite.css.svg`, use them as
```
<svg class="text-tertiary" aria-hidden="true" width="24" height="24">
  <use href="/img/icons/symbol/svg/sprite.css.svg#hamburger"></use>
</svg>
```

* All URLs must end with `/`, e.g. `permalink: "/forex-brokers/tickmill/"`
* The single most important way to group items is:

  ```
  ---
  tags: ["tools", "calculators"]
  ---
  ```

* ...this will create `collections.tools` and `collections.calculators` collections which you can iterate through later with e.g. `{% for item in collections.tools %}`.
* `src/sitemap.njk` is responsible for generating the `sitemap.xml`, double-check its conditions in case you want to exclude some pages, collections from it.
* `TODO`: Update the `robots.txt` once deployed to production.
* The main entry point for all CSS work is in `/src/sass/main.scss`. The order of `@import`-s is important.

## üîç Search (optional, TODO)

Since this is 11ty, there are no API calls neither a DB to fetch posts, rather `collections.all`. We are fetching all posts with

```
<div id="search-all-posts">
    {# NOTE: the content comes from collections.all #}
    {% set posts = collections.all %}
    {% include "components/article-list-search-results.njk" %}
</div>
```

...and then show/hide them with the `.d-none` class from JS (all items all hidden by default, prior to the search).

## Top Comparison pages
The top comparison pages can be accessed from the top navbar or direct link e.g. https://forexchurch-ten.vercel.app/forex-brokers/top-comparisons/capital-vs-pepperstone/?brokers=capital%7Cpepperstone


1. each broker has a `.json` file at https://github.com/talpitoo/forexchurch-11ty-alpinejs-bootstrap/tree/master/src/_data/brokers
2. each 'top comparison' page is just a simple `.njk` where all the details (e.g. broker 1, broker 2) are set up via front matter https://github.com/talpitoo/forexchurch-11ty-alpinejs-bootstrap/tree/master/src/pages/forex-brokers/top-comparisons
3. everything else (the layout of the vs. page) comes from https://github.com/talpitoo/forexchurch-11ty-alpinejs-bootstrap/blob/master/src/_includes/layouts/vs.njk So assuming that all comparisons are 100% identical this single page layout covers all possible broker comparisons (assuming there is data)
4. for all that i needed to add URL parameters to the top navigation e.g. https://github.com/talpitoo/forexchurch-11ty-alpinejs-bootstrap/blob/master/src/_includes/components/navigation-url-parameters.njk#L74
5. this way the 'top comparison' pages can be generated at build time with `npm run build` and they will appear as static pages inside the `_site` folder, perfect for SEO. The text will be static, the tables and charts will be dynamic once the page loads and Alpine.js does its thing.
