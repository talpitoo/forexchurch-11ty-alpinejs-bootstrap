                <p>Forex brokers are our gateway to the global Interbank foreign exchange market. Whenever you want to trade a particular foreign currency pair, you are buying one currency in exchange for another. Forex brokers either buy or sell you the currency or they direct your order to their liquidity providers, who then match your order with other willing parties.</p>
                <p>Basically, Forex brokers facilitate access to the market by providing a platform to both retail and institutional traders.</p>
                <p>Besides providing a centralized trading platform and access to markets, Forex brokers also provide their clients with margin trading facility. Hence, with the power of broker provided leverage, retail Forex traders can trade much larger sums. Without this ability to use high leverage, which often starts from 100:1 and can be as high as 500:1, the Forex market may not have been so attractive.</p>
                <p>Besides Forex, there are very few markets where you can deposit a mere $1,000 into your brokerage account and trade as much as $100,000 or even $500,000 worth of foreign currency and get to keep any profits.</p>
                <p>Technically, when you go to a foreign country and exchange your home country`s currency to buy some travel cash in the destination country from a foreign exchange dealer at the airport, it is also part of the global Forex market. However, the difference between such a small-scale dealer and your Forex broker is how the law distinguishes these two entities.</p>
                <h3 class="h2">Why Strict Regulation is a Key Factor in the Forex Brokerage Industry?</h3>
                <p>You see, providing access to the global Forex market is a privilege in most jurisdictions. Because unlike your local foreign currency dealer, Forex brokers act as custodians of large sums of capital deposited by their clients who come from all walks of life.</p>
                <p>There have been a lot of unfortunate incidents in the past when even reputed brokers with thousands of clients suddenly vanished off the face of the earth and embezzled millions of Dollars. Even in well-regulated markets like in the United States, there were several high-profile scandals. In one instance, an Iowa-based US Forex Broker called Peregrine Financial Group (PFG) was investigated for embezzling $200 million of customer funds!</p>
                <p>Even today, if you search for Scam Brokers, you will find hundreds of brokers operate from small Island nations with more or less bucket shop business models. Therefore, Governments in major financial hubs around the world control the Forex brokerage market through their financial regulatory authorities. If you are looking to sign-up with a Forex broker, make sure that the broker in question is licensed to conduct brokerage business in its respective country and is preferably regulated.</p>
                <p>While the level of fraud in the industry went down significantly over the last decade, you should still remain very vigilant and it is best to stick with brokers who are regulated in a major developed country. Since the introduction of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, a lot of major Forex brokers in the USA moved their operations abroad, where regulatory measures are more business-friendly. In light of the strict regulatory requirements and trading restictions enforced by the CFTC in the USA and despite the fact that as a result not many international forex brokers offer services to US citizens, there are still a few that do. A list of some of these can be viewed here: <a href="#" class="btn btn-underline p-0"><span>Brokers For US Traders</span></a></p>
                <p>Over the last decade, major financial hubs like Sydney, London, Singapore, and a number of other cities have attracted Forex brokers. In fact, as a direct consequence of the Dodd-Frank act, a lot of best Forex brokers have shifted their business to Australia and the United Kingdom and decided to be regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Check here for a list of <a href="#" class="btn btn-underline p-0"><span>brokers regulated by ASIC</span></a> and here for a list of <a href="#" class="btn btn-underline p-0"><span>brokers regulated by FCA</span></a>.</p>
                <h3 class="h2">Regulatory Oversight</h3>
                <p>As we mentioned before, regulatory oversight is one of the most important factors in picking a broker. Here are some of the top authorities from around the world and their respective legislative jurisdiction that you should check before signing up with a broker that claims to be regulated by that country.</p>
