                    <p>Broker safety and regulation are critical elements to consider when choosing a broker, particularly in forex trading, where the risk of scam brokers is notable. To assess broker safety, we focus on:</p>
                    <ul class="list-bullet">
                        <li>The regulatory authorities governing the broker's operations, giving added weight to number of Tier 1 licenses.</li>

                        <li>Financial protection features like negative balance protection.</li>

                    <h3>Comparing {{ brokers[broker1].name }} vs. {{ brokers[broker2].name }}: Which Offers Lower Trading Fees?</h3>
                    <p>Trading costs are an important factor to consider when choosing a broker because net trading profits are trading profits minus trading costs and any applicable taxes.</p>
                    <p>Many brokers offer a choice of accounts that charge spread-fees-only or commission-fees-only for forex trading. If the broker also provides access to trade other financial markets, trading fees for trading assets in those markets may be assessed in the form of spread fees, commission fees, or a combination of spread and commission fees.</p>
                    <p>Before choosing a broker, examine its specific trading fees for all financial assets that you expect to regularly trade – as well as any non-trading related fees, such as deposit/withdrawal, inactivity and account fees. These can have a big impact on a traders success.</p>
                    <p>Below is a comparison of {{ brokers[broker1].name }} and {{ brokers[broker2].name }} commissions and average spreads on the majors:</p>
