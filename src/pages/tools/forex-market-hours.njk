    <p class="mt-16px">It is important to remember that each of the forex session times are approximations as to when trading activity picks up and is influenced by the relative region/session. Globally, forex session times are a general indication not hard fixed times - they are influenced by many factors, including when local businessâ€™ open and close.</p>
    <p>Session times also vary according to daylight savings times in the relative regions - so the Sydney, London and New York forex session times are impacted by daylight savings, whereas Tokyo is not. And to make matters more complicated, the Sydney session is in the southern hemisphere, so their daylight savings season is opposite to that of London and New York.</p>
