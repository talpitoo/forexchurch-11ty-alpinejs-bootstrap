excerpt: >
  The Margin Calculator calculates the margin required to maintain an open position. The Margin Calculator factors in a number variables to work out the required margin - the Base currency of the account, the pair you will be opening a trade in, the leverage of your account, the trade size and the current price for the pair. All variables are required to be filled in in orderder to derive the required margin. The "Current Price" field is automatically filled in for you with the latest price required for the pair required to work out the margin - you can also use your own custom price.

    <h2>Forex Trading with Fibonacci Calculator to Stay Ahead of the Curve</h2>
    <p>Fibonacci numbers were introduced to the European academic circle by an Italian mathematician named Leonardo Bigollo Pisano, better known as Fibonacci. He introduced the Indian numerical system in this famous book Liber Abaci (1202). However, the reason Forex traders are grateful to this mathematician is the amazing application of the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
    <p>You can easily apply the Fibonacci sequence in Forex trading with the aid of our Fibonacci Calculator.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-fibonacci" class="forexchurch-anchor-offset">What is Fibonacci?</h2>
        <p>The Fibonacci sequence is made up of a series of numbers where each number is the sum of two preceding numbers. While the Fibonacci sequence starts from 0, most academic books start the count from 1. However, in trading, the value of 0 is also important and we will discuss it later in the application of the sequence in trading.</p>
        <p>Anyways, the Fibonacci formula is:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote bg-light px-24px py-16px border-start border-5 border-tertiary fs-6 fw-medium fst-italic">
          <p>Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So, if n = 1, the Fibonacci formula would formulate the following sequence of numbers:</p>
        <p><strong>1, 1, (1+1) 2, (1+2) 3, (2+3) 5, (3+5) 8, ... 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144... and so on.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="why-the-fibonacci-sequence-is-so-important" class="forexchurch-anchor-offset">Why the Fibonacci Sequence is So Important in Trading Forex?</h2>
        <p>The Fibonacci sequence, which is closely related to Golden ratio, is often found in nature and the concept still baffles scientists researching about natural phenomena, such as the evolution of species and plants. For example - to name a few - the Fibonacci sequence can be found in human faces, seed heads, flower petals, tree branches, spiral galaxies, and hurricanes.</p>
        <p>While using Fibonacci levels in trading is not a bulletproof system, the Fibonacci levels often become major support and resistance levels. And, when there is a confluence of Fibonacci levels with historical support and resistance, traders can utilize these levels to pinpoint where the price of a pair might stop and reverse. Furthermore, armed with the knowledge about where key Fibonacci levels are located, you can easily reduce your exposure to a trade or even look for reversal opportunities.</p>
